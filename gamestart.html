		You are a typical museum enthusiast, always wanting to learn new things. One day you decide 
		to go an Ancient Artifact Museum which is brand new. You get there only to see that 
		there is hardly anyone at this museum, you brush this observation to the side and begin to 
		explore the many exhibits and rooms they have. All of the sudden the lights go off and all the 
		doors shut, and a mysterious voice comes over the intercom system saying that the museum is 
		currently under quarantine and is being gassed for sanitation purposes. This gas is poisonous 
		and if you inhale to much you will die. It is your job to find your way out the museum before you 
		have inhaled too much of the gas. You can find your way out by finding keys which will unlock 
		doors for you to find your way out.
